 COVID-19, caused by the highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus, poses a global threat with severe respiratory implications. Early detection is crucial, considering the virus's contagiousness and potential fatality. Timely identification is vital for prompt treatment and preventing complications. While existing tests are available, they can be expensive and time-consuming. This project addresses these challenges by developing a machine learning model. Leveraging patient symptoms, age, and medical history, the model predicts infection with high precision. Trained on a dataset from the Mexican government, it includes anonymized patient information, including pre-conditions.
